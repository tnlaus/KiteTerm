# Screenshots

This folder holds images referenced by the README.

## Needed

- `screenshot-hero.png` — Full app window showing 3-4 tabs, one active with Claude Code running (1200x800, PNG)
- `demo.gif` — 15-20 second GIF showing: create workspace → terminal opens → switch tabs → close/reopen

## How to capture

Once the app is running, use any screen recording tool (ShareX, OBS, or Windows Game Bar) to capture the workflow. For the GIF, keep it under 5MB for fast loading on GitHub.

Alternatively, ask Claude Code:
```
"Take screenshots of the running app for the README. Capture the main window with 3 tabs open, 
the workspace creation modal, and the system tray menu."
```
